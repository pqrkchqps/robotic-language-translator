Writing Assignment 2: 
-------------------------------
This part of iteration 3 asked you and your partner to write comments
in your code describing the incremental development process that you
used in your work.  It is to be written by both members of the
partnership.

_b__ : correct grammar, spelling or punctuation 

_b_ : comments are properly indented and formatted to make them
      easy to read 

_b_ : comments in ast_tests.h and parser.cpp are clear, concise,
      accurate in that they match the code. 

_c_ : comments indicate the order in which the test cases were
      implemented and made to pass.

_c_ : comments clearly and concisely decribe the incremental
      development approach used during the development of
      iteration 3.  There is evidence in the code of this
      approach.  The approach taken was a reasonable one.

comments :
