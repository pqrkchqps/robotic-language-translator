Possible points: 80.

Code Development Process: 40 possible points.
---------------------------------------------

(These points are assessed once, on the due date.)

Correct use of Git (10 points).  Are each of the following
files (or directories) in the correct place in your
team repository? 

__5_ /  5:  tag "iter2" used properly
__1_ /  1: project/samples/bad_syntax_good_tokens.stm
           project/samples/abstar.stm
           project/samples/box.stm
           project/samples/sumOfSquares.stm
           project/src/Makefile
__1_ /  1: project/src/extToken.h
           project/src/extToken.cpp
           project/src/parseResult.h
           project/src/parseResult.cpp
__1_ /  1: project/src/parser.h
           project/src/parser.cpp 
           project/src/parser_tests.h
__1_ /  1: project/lib/cxxtest
           project/src/readInput.h
           project/src/readInput.cpp
           project/src/regex.h
           project/src/regex.cpp
           project/src/regex_tests.h
           project/src/scanner.h
           project/src/scanner.cpp
           project/src/scanner_tests.h
__1_ /  1: project/src/iteration2_work.txt


Division of work statement (10 points possible).

_10_ / 10: An satisfactory  division of work statement.


Successful compilation and generation of tests cases.  (10 points)
Each of the following commands should succeed with no errors.

__4_ /  4: make parser.o.cpp
__3_ /  3: make parser_tests.cpp
__0_ /  3: make parser_tests
          make parser_tests failed


Running test cases doesn't result in a segmentation fault. (10 possible points)
Test cases may fail, but should not cause the testing framework to
crash. 

__0_ / 10: No segmentation faults
          make parser.o parser_tests.cpp or parser_tests failed could not continue



Passing Test Cases: 40 points.
------------------------------
(These points are assessed at each iteration and thus if you fail to
pass some test cases now you can get those points back on a later
iteration.)

__0_ /  5: passes the test  test_parser_bad_syntax
          make failure, see above
__0_ /  5: passes the test  test_parser_exprs
          make failure, see above
__0_ / 10: passes the test  test_parser_abstar
          make failure, see above
__0_ / 10: passes the test  test_parser_box
          make failure, see above
__0_ / 10: passes the test  test_parser_sumOfSquares
          make failure, see above
